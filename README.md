This C code manages student data, including adding, searching, modifying, deleting, and organizing students based on their academic information :

1. search():
Purpose: Searches for a student by their unique identifier (ID).
Description: This function takes an ID as input and searches through the student records file to find and display the student’s details. If the student is found, their data is shown, otherwise an error message is returned.

2. add():
Purpose: Adds a new student to the records.
Description: This function collects input for a student’s details (name, ID, marks, etc.), calculates their average, and appends this information into the records file. The new student’s data is stored in a structured format.

3. modify():
Purpose: Modifies an existing student's data.
Description: This function allows updating specific details of a student, such as their marks or other personal information. After the modifications, it updates the student's record in the file.

4. supression_physique() (Physical Deletion):
Purpose: Permanently deletes a student's record from the file.
Description: This function removes the student’s information entirely from the records file. It requires rewriting the file, excluding the student whose record is being deleted.

5. supression_logique() (Logical Deletion):
Purpose: Marks a student’s record as deleted without physically removing it from the file.
Description: Instead of deleting the student's record, this function marks the record as deleted (e.g., by updating the status or flag to "deleted"). This way, the record still exists but is treated as inactive in further operations.

6. extraction_by_group_number() (Extraction by Group Number):
Purpose: Extracts or filters student records by their group number.
Description: This function filters the student records based on a specific group number. It scans through the records and retrieves only the students who belong to the specified group, displaying their information

7. reorganization():
Purpose: Reorganizes the student records in a specific order or structure.
Description: This function reorganizes the student records based on a specific criterion, such as sorting by student names, IDs, or average marks. After the records are sorted or reordered, they are written back into the file, ensuring that the list is maintained in the new desired order.
